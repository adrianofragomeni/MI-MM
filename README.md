# (MI)llion-(M)ax(M)argin (MI-MM)
Code and Data of the MIllion-MaxMargin model used as basiline for the EPIC-KITCHENS-100 Multi-Instance Retrieval Challenge.

## Data
The data directory contains 4 folders:
* `dataframes`: It contains the train and validation csv files of EPIC-Kitchens.
* `features`: It contains the training and validation features of EPIC-Kitchens extracted by the S3D model trained on HowTo100M whose implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/antoine77340/S3D_HowTo100M).
* `relevancy`: It contains the training relevancy matrix needed to train the model.
* `resources`: It contains the weights of the S3D model trained on HowTo100M and the word embeddings.
